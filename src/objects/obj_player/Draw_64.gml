	//If you want to see the value of a variable displayed in-game, replace VARIABLENAME with that variable below 
	//For example, placing replacing 'VARIABLENAME' with 'x' will display the x position of the player at the top left of the screen
	//Helpful for testing out values to see if things are working properly, or to see what values work best for a desired effect
