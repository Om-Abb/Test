# Test
This is an ongoing development project as I learn to code using Gamemaker Studio 2 

The ultimate goal is to create a 2D platformer with a grappling hook element.

I am starting from scratch, and documenting the code so that other aspiring developers with little to no programming experience can hopefully learn alongside me.

The vast majority of actual code can be found in .gml files under src>objects and src>scripts

[Here is a link to the game itself, in it's current state](https://github.com/Om-Abb/Test/blob/main/src/Test.zip)
