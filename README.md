# Test
This is an ongoing development project as I learn to code with GML to create games. 
The ultimate goal is to create a 2D platformer with a grappling hook element.
I am starting from scratch, and ocumenting the code so that other aspiring developers with little to no programming experience can hopefully learn alongside me.
Each commit features a new concept that I have learned, applied, and clearly documented.
