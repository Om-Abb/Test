# Grapple Boy
This is an ongoing development project as I learn to code using Gamemaker Studio 2 

The ultimate goal is to create a 2D platformer with a grappling hook element.

I am starting from scratch, and documenting the code so that other aspiring developers with little to no programming experience can hopefully learn from it.

The vast majority of code can be found in .gml files under src>objects and src>scripts

For example, code for the player character is located in the .gml files in [Grapple-Boy/src/objects/obj_player/](https://github.com/abbasio/Grapple-Boy/blob/main/src/objects/obj_player/)

[Here is a link to the game itself, in it's current state](https://github.com/Om-Abb/Test/blob/main/src/Test.zip)
