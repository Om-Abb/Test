# Test
This is an ongoing development project as I learn to code with GML. 

The ultimate goal is to create a 2D platformer with a grappling hook element.

I am starting from scratch, and documenting the code so that other aspiring developers with little to no programming experience can hopefully learn alongside me.

Each commit features a new concept that I have learned, applied, and clearly documented. 

The vast majority of actual code lies under src>objects and src>scripts

Here is a link to the actual game itself, in it's current state: https://github.com/Om-Abb/Test/blob/main/src/Test.zip
